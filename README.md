<b>Java Spring REST API</b> with <b>JWT</b> authentication cookie.  
This is the development branch for the backend application deployed in Heroku from <b>offers-rest-jwt-cookies-herocu</b> branch.
The existence of a separate branch for deployment is necessary because of the <b>bPostgreSQL</b> database that is used in Heroku.
Using of PostgreSQL requires small changes in the database requests.  
For detailed description please visit the deployment branch https://github.com/IlkoPanchev/offers-rest-jwt-cookies-herocu/tree/master
